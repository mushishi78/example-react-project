# Conventions

Conventions are often preferrable to programmed solution if they avoid having to
maintain code. However they rely on team discipline and explicit documentation.

## Namespaces for css files

To avoid name collisions, a prefix for all styles in a file should be used.
Prefixs should be 2-3 letters long, followed by an underscore, and completely
aribtrary.

They should be listed here in alphabetical to avoid being reused:

aa - Tetris.Component.Board
ab - Lib.base
